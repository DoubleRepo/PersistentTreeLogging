# PersistentTreeLogging
Tree Logging Persistent for Exile.

# Todo
Make tree's regrow realistic by setting a status code to the entry after a "" mount of days. 

From that status code spawn in small bush, medium bush or big bush/small tree.

Give option to "regrowing" tree to "pull out" so its gone again and reset status code.

## Configuration

Add inside your mission config.cpp at the cfgcustomcode ExileServer_object_tree_network_chopTreeRequest and use the file provided inside MpMission/overwrites.

Add the additions from Exile.ini to your Exile.ini.

Drag the Server Addon to your ExileServer Addons folder and profit.
